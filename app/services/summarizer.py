summarizer.py

This module defines the Summarizer service, responsible for generating a personal
emotional summary for each speaker.

Responsibilities:
- Receive:
    - Full transcript (text)
    - Emotion data per speaker
    - Speaker segmentation data
- Generate:
    - Per-speaker summary including:
        - General emotional tone
        - Identified emotional triggers
        - Suggested improvements or insights (if needed)

Supports:
- Rule-based or LLM-based summarization (e.g., Azure OpenAI in future)

Note:
This is a placeholder implementation â€“ actual logic will be added later.
