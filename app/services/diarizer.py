diarizer.py

This module defines the Diarizer service, responsible for speaker diarization â€“
determining "who spoke when" in an audio file.

Responsibilities:
- Receive a path to an audio file
- Use a diarization engine to identify speaker segments:
    - pyannote-audio (locally)
    - or Azure Conversation Transcription API (if available)
- Return a list of speaker-labeled time segments

Note:
Each segment includes start time, end time, and speaker label (e.g., "Speaker 1").
Integration backend (pyannote or Azure) will be added later.
