emotion_analyzer.py

This module defines the EmotionAnalyzer service, responsible for detecting emotions
in speech segments using acoustic features.

Responsibilities:
- Receive a path to an audio file and a list of speaker segments
- Analyze each segment to detect vocal emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry)
- Return structured emotion data per speaker over time

Supports:
- Local emotion detection models
- or Azure Cognitive Services (Speech/Emotion APIs)

Note:
The backend will be selected based on configuration in future versions.
